# Dance Away

Yesterday, when it seemed so cool
When I walked you home, kissed goodnight
I said, "It's love", you said, "Alright"
It's funny how, I could never cry
Until tonight, when you pass by
Hand in hand with another guy
You're dressed to kill and guess who's dying

Dance away the heartache
Dance away the tears
Dance away the heartache
Dance away the fear
Dance away
